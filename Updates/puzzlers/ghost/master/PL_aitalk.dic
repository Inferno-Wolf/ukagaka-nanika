// \f[color0-255,0-255,0-255] changes the color of the text. \f[color,default] will return the color to default.
/// \f[color,default.anchor] will change the colour of the text to the one set as the anchor for the balloon!
// \f[default] returns everything back to normal.

// \_a[[http://www.website.com/](put text here)\_a can link a website in dialogue.
// \0\s[0]\1\s[0]\_s(put dialogue here)\_s has characters say dialogue at the same time. Using \_s[0,1](text here)\_s specifies which characters are speaking at the same time (in this case, the Sakura, 0, and the Kero, 1).
// \_b[name.png,50,50,centerxy] displays an image in the balloon. can use (inline) to have it follow the text and (--option=use_self_alpha) for transparency
// \![set,balloontimeout,-1] makes it so the balloon doesn't disappear / time out. helpful for input choices like nameteach!
// \![set,autoscroll,disable] exactly as it says, disables autoscroll. helpful for long menus!
// \![set,balloonwait,0.1] controls the speed of the text. default set at 1, 0.1 is faster, 2+ are slower
// \c[char,6] clears the previous 6 characters; basically deleting specific things!!
