======/Important Notice!/=========
Layton and Luke include spoilers for the entire Layton series of games (and the Eternal Diva movie and Layton's Mystery Journey anime), as well as references to Death, Nonconsensual drug use, Kidnapping, Unhealthy relationships, Unhealthy coping mechanisms, and Child endangerment. These references are mostly vague, but take care if you find any of these upsetting.
==================================


--Puzzle 001--

It looks like you've found Professor Layton and his trusty apprentice Luke in the midst of their adventures! Offer them a place to stay on your desktop (as well as a small mystery) and enjoy their company as they chat to one another about all of their experiences and friends. They may ask you a multiple choice question or two, have a simple relationship progression system, and can be served tea! (Though, take care not to jostle them, or they might spill their cups.)
The two will also pretend to give puzzles to one another, so don't worry about having to solve anything. They'll handle all that on their own!

Now, some quick basics on what an ukagaka / ghost is!
--Right click on the Main Character (in this case, Layton) to bring up the SSP right-click menu.
--Double click the Main Character to bring up their own personal menu. Try not to disturb his hat!
--Double click the Secondary Character (Luke, in this case) to bring up their menu. Stroke your mouse over Luke's hat to give him a pat on the head!
--Highlighted/underlined words are either hyperlinks which may open your browser or more dialogue explaining things!

Hotkeys include:
  - T > Makes them play one of their random dialogues.
  - R > Repeats the last dialogue said. (Doesn't work with menu options or anchor explanations, only their idle dialogue.)
  - F1 > Brings up this readme.txt

--Reload your ghost by going into the right-click SSP menu (of the Main Character), going to Utilities, then going to Reload Ghost. You can also reload them by choosing Switch Ghost and clicking on their name.
--Change shells by going into the right-click SSP menu (of the Main Character), going to Change Shell, and choosing which one you'd like for them to use.

And there you have it! Looks like you'll be a true Ukagaka expert in no time!

Puzzle solved! Correct! 20/20 Picarats earned!
