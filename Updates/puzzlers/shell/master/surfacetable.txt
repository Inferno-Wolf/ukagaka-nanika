//You can also use this to disable surfaces you don't want to appear in the surfacetable.txt list. Now, disabling a group of surfaces is pretty simple. You don't have to add a disabled group if you don't need one. But if you do, here's how.

//group,__disabled
//{
//9999,__parts
//}

//In this case, we made a group called __disabled. Any surfaces you don't want to appear in Surface Test, you can put into the __disabled group. I don't think nicknames are really necessary for them, I just called this one __parts for no reason, but it probably doesn't hurt.

//Once you've set up this file, you're all set! You should see the changes in the surface test immediately once you reload your shell.
