Seems like you were able to find the last tin can you could in this pandemic of failing organs. Joy!
Unfortunately, you don't have a can opener, so all you can really do with it is tap it and stare at it, wondering what mysteries it holds for you.
(This is a Presentable Liberty / Exoptable Money reference.)
