Seems like you were able to find the last tin can you could in this pandemic of failing organs. Joy!
Unfortunately, you don't have a can opener, so all you can really do with it is tap it and stare at it, wondering what mysteries it holds for you.
(This is a Presentable Liberty / Exoptable Money reference.)

========== Content Warning =============
This ghost uses similar themes to both Exoptable Money / Presentable Liberty, those being:
	- Hopelessness
	- Despair
	- Lies and Deceit (towards you specifically)
	- A global pandemic / plague
	- Death and Suicide
	- Capitalism and unchecked greed
	- Parasocial relationships
=======================================


——— Important note ———
This template has a simple Emergency Mode set up. This means that if there is an error in your dic files, it will load *just* the files in yaya_base and emerg.dic, and nothing else. I left it in there because I wasn't sure how exactly to delete it.
