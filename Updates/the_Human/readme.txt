*Hello!!

Thank you for downloading my Frisk Ghost! They are small and simple, but hopefully you can enjoy their random chatter as they hang out on your desktop. They have a few self care reminders as well as some surprise guests and are here to present as positive an experience as they can manage considering those rude interlopers.

They're a bit noisy, also, so make sure your settings either allow you to hear their sounds (if you like that sort of thing) or keep them muted so they don't bother you.
(Just right-click Frisk and check 'Don't Play Sound' under Options > Ghost Preferences.)

If you don't agree with my visual interpretation of Frisk, then you can make your own! I purposely designed their base shell as easy to replace as possible so you can add your own interpretation! (And if you don't want to draw new surprise guests, then you're allowed to use my images for them as well.) Just make sure all your files are the same sizes, as Frisk has a few tricks concerning these special guests.

I left all the commentary in the surfaces.txt file for my scribblefrisk shell, so you can read up how things work in there if you feel like going the extra mile and making sure all the hitboxes are correct! (Or head on down to Zarla's site, http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, which has more up-to-date information on shell coding.) If not, then they'll still function as long as you replace all the images, but petting or checking them might become difficult.

I only ask that you send your shell to me as well, as I'd love to see it. ;w;
With your permission, I could even add it to Frisk's files for future updates to download!
(warning: if you don't want that, then future updates may bork your shell if you don't remove it from your personal files before updating. please keep this in mind so you don't lose all your hard work ;w; )


--Some quick common Ghost things------------------------
Right-click Frisk to bring up the SSP right-click menu.
Double-click Frisk's body to bring up their personal menu.
Double-click or run your mouse cursor over Frisk's head or face for some clicking / petting dialogue!
(You can also pet and click on one of the special guests, but they won't appreciate it as much.)
Underlined text are links that may open your browser.

--Hotkeys-----------------------------------------------
"T" -- Force Frisk to say something.
"R" -- Repeats the last dialogue said. (Doesn't work with menu options or anchor explanations, only their random dialogue.)

You can reload them by going into the SSP menu, going to Utilities, then going to Reload Ghost.
You can also do this by going to the Change Ghost option in the SSP menu and selecting their name. They have a lot of dialogue for this option because I'm a weirdo. =7=
