-Some swearing, can be rude and abrasive, talk of eating bugs, dirt, food, and gross things.

It seems a gremlin has wandered into your forest and is poking about for goodies to eat. Should you leave her to it and listen to her grumble about her many friends? Or should you introduce yourself and get to know her?

(Movement options are disabled by default but can be enabled through her menu.)
