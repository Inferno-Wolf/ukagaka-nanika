It is of that rather heedless consulting detective Herlock Sholmes! (Specifically, from the game The Great Ace Attorney by CAPCOM.) Seems like he may want to dance with you, so give him some space on your desktop to do just that!
Now, this man is a bit of a disaster, especially with remembering names, so don't be too surprised if he suddenly decides to call you something other than what you told him. He might not know the correct month, either, and he's more of a night owl than a morning person.
But hopefully, he can keep you company a while. And look pleasing as he's doing it!


--Basic Ghost Usage Tips-------------

Double-clicking Herlock's body will bring up his menu, where you can ask him to talk or change some Configuration things.
Right click Herlock's body to bring up the SSP Menu, where you can swap ghosts, reload Herlock, change his shell scaling, and more!
Double-click or move your mouse cursor over Herlock's head/face for more fun interaction!
Underlined text are links that may open your browser.


--Hotkeys------------
  "T" forces Herlock to say something (pulled from his Aitalk file)
  "R" has Herlock repeat his last dialogue (also pulled from his Aitalk file; does not repeat menu dialogues or anchor explanations)
