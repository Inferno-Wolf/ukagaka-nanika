//Alright, install.txt for your balloon just gives it instructions for what to do if it's dropped on an existing ghost. It tells the program where and how to install it. As you can see, it's super short and very easy to fill out. In fact, there are only two things you need to touch.

//This should always be UTF-8.


type,balloon
//it's a balloon.


name,Little Myloon
//defined in descript.txt.


directory,miiloon
//Folder name.
