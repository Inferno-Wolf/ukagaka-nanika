Thank you for downloading our ghost for the 2024 ukagaka/ghost game jam!

This character is Artoria Caster (Castoria for short) from popular video game Fate/Grand Order. This resourceful fairy will gladly tell you all about her homeland, her friends, and a bunch of other things!

CONTENT WARNINGS:
Chronologically, Castoria hails from the aftermath of her adventure. Meaning she is dead. She does occasionally mentions her death and its circumstances, albeit in vague terms. Additionally, while Castoria mostly acts kind and helpful, she does occasionally get really bitter and vitriolic. This will never be targetted towards you as a user, but I figure this warrants a warning regardless.
(There is also one reference to canonical petplay.)

--Castoria is here to chill. She'll mostly hang out on your computer and make conversation with  you.
--Castoria has a lot of clickable options in her dialogues! Make sure to keep an eye out for when she's asking you a question.
--Castoria can do a lot of simple functions such as emptying your bin or checking your calendar. She's ressourceful like that!

Some notes to use on how ghosts work:
-Right click on the Sakura to bring up the SSP right-click menu.
-Double click the Sakura to bring up their own personal menu (make note if you've coded in any specific collisions on them, such as their face for punching).
-Double click the Kero to bring up their menu (same notes as for the Sakura).
-Stroking your mouse over certain collisions, if coded in, will result in petting. (More details on that in the mouse.dic file)
-Highlighted/underlined words can be Hyperlinks or Anchors. (More details on that in the anchor.dic file)
-Hit the "T" key to force your ghost to talk (dialogue will be pulled from the OnAitalk function).
-Hit the "R" key to force your ghost to repeat their last dialogue (will only work for OnAitalk dialogue; if you've fixed the line and reload them, they'll still repeat the dialogue as it was last written, since they store it for this function)
-Reload your ghost by going into the right-click SSP menu (of the Sakura), going to Utilities, then going to Reload Ghost. You can also reload them by choosing Switch Ghost and clicking on their name.
-Bring up the Developer Console by hitting Ctrl-Shift-D (can be enabled or disabled in the right-click SSP meny through Preferences -> Enable Functions for Developers)

First Template was built on top of GT Template (found here -> http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/), which was in turn based off of a ghost written by cindysuke (which has since been taken down or stored; her site -> cindysuke.deviantart.com).
Huge thanks to the Ukagaka community (https://ukagakadreamteam.tumblr.com/), as always.
