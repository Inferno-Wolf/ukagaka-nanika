//5. -- Choice Markers

cursor.blendmethod,none
cursor.style,underline

//cursor.style defines how the balloon displays a choice. You can put underline, square, or square+underline. As you can guess, this will either underline the option, put a square around it, or do both.
//If you set cursor.style to square, you'll need to set blendmethod as well. There are three values you can put after blendmethod. They are none, notmaskpen, and mergepennot. None keeps the square the same color, notmaskpen blends the color of the text and the background and then inverts it (supposedly), and mergepennot overlays the brush.color (below) over your text.
//In most cases, I would recommend leaving blendmethod as none and cursor.style as underline. You won't have to mess with these very much if that's the case. If you're feeling creative though, you can mess with blendmethod and see if you like how it looks.
